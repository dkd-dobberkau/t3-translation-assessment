# AI Augmentation Disclosure

> TLDR: I used AI as a collaborative tool to enhance my work—similar to using a calculator or word processor—while maintaining my human judgment, direction, and critical thinking throughout the process. The final product represents a thoughtful blend of AI assistance and my own unique contributions.

In developing this work, I've thoughtfully integrated AI tools to enhance my capabilities while maintaining the integrity of my personal contribution. AI has served as a collaborative partner in my process—helping me organize thoughts, explore perspectives, and refine my ideas.

Much like earlier technological advances that extended human capacity, from the printing press to digital photography, AI offers new ways to augment our thinking and creativity. I view this technology not as a replacement for human judgment and creativity, but as a tool that allows me to focus my energy on the uniquely human elements of my work: the original insights, critical analysis, and creative connections that reflect my personal understanding.

The final product represents a synthesis of AI assistance and my own direction, discernment, and decision-making. I've carefully reviewed and shaped all AI-generated content to ensure it accurately reflects my intentions and meets the standards I uphold in my work.

I believe transparency about AI use honors both the technological tools that support us and the irreplaceable human judgment that guides them.
