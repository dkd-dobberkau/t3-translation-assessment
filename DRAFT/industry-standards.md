**Relevance to TYPO3:** Used in conjunction with language codes to define locale-specific variants (e.g., en-US, en-GB).

### ISO 21720:2017 (XLIFF)
**Description:** The ISO standard for XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format), which standardizes how localizable data is passed between tools during a localization process.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** TYPO3 uses XLIFF for its language files, making this standard directly applicable.

### ISO 30042:2019 (TBX)
**Description:** TermBase eXchange (TBX) is the international standard for terminology exchange.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Relevant for advanced terminology management integration with TYPO3.

## W3C Standards and Recommendations

### W3C Internationalization (i18n)
**Description:** Guidelines and best practices for designing and developing websites and applications that can be easily adapted for different languages and regions.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Fundamental principles for TYPO3's internationalization approach.

### W3C Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)
**Description:** A technology to add metadata to content to support the internationalization and localization processes, including information on whether content should be translated.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Provides a standardized approach for marking content for translation that could be adopted by TYPO3.

### HTML Language Attribute (lang)
**Description:** The HTML attribute used to declare the language of a Web page or a portion of a Web page.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Essential for proper language identification in rendered HTML content.

### BCP 47 - Tags for Identifying Languages
**Description:** Defines a standard for creating language tags used for identifying languages in Internet protocols and markup languages.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Should be considered as an alternative to TYPO3's current numeric language ID system.

## OASIS Standards

### XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format)
**Description:** An XML-based format created to standardize the way localizable data are passed between tools during a localization process.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Used by TYPO3 for language resource files (labels).

### OAXAL (Open Architecture for XML Authoring and Localization)
**Description:** A reference architecture that describes a processing model for authoring and localizing XML documents using open standards.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Provides a comprehensive framework that could inform future development of TYPO3's translation system.

### DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture)
**Description:** An XML-based architecture for creating, managing, and publishing technical content.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Relevant for technical documentation translation in complex TYPO3 projects.

## Other Industry Standards

### TMX (Translation Memory eXchange)
**Description:** An open XML standard for the exchange of translation memory data created by computer-aided translation software.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Could be integrated into TYPO3 extensions for improved translation memory capabilities.

### SRX (Segmentation Rules eXchange)
**Description:** An XML-based standard used to describe how to segment text for translation.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Important for consistent translation memory matching and machine translation quality.

### GMX (Global Information Management Metrics Exchange)
**Description:** Standards for metrics exchange, including word counts, complexity levels, and quality metrics for translation.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Could be integrated into TYPO3 translation extensions for better project estimation and quality control.

### Unicode
**Description:** An international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts that ensures texts are encoded in a consistent way.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Fundamental to TYPO3's ability to store and display multilingual content correctly.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### GALA (Globalization and Localization Association) Guidelines
**Description:** Industry best practices for globalization, internationalization, localization, and translation.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Provides guidance for implementing translation systems that meet industry standards.

### T13N Best Practices
**Description:** Best practices for translation and localization processes, including workflows, quality control, and terminology management.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Offers guidance for optimizing translation workflows in TYPO3.

### W3C Internationalization Best Practices
**Description:** Guidance on internationalization aspects of web development, including character encoding, language negotiation, and locale-specific formatting.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Directly applicable to TYPO3's rendering and content management approaches.

### LISA (Localization Industry Standards Association) Legacy
**Description:** Although LISA disbanded in 2011, many of its standards and best practices continue to influence the industry.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** LISA's work on TMX, TBX, and other standards remains relevant for TYPO3 translation systems.

## Emerging Standards and Trends

### TAPICC (Translation API Cases and Classes)
**Description:** An initiative to develop open-source APIs for translation and localization processes.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Could inform future API development for TYPO3's translation system.

### Continuous Localization
**Description:** An approach that integrates localization into continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Increasingly important for large-scale TYPO3 projects with frequent content updates.

### Neural Machine Translation Integration Standards
**Description:** Emerging standards for integrating neural machine translation services into content workflows.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** Important for future machine translation integration in TYPO3.

### Remote Interpreting Standards (ISO/PAS 24019)
**Description:** Guidelines for platform selection and use of remote interpreting services.  
**Relevance to TYPO3:** May be relevant for multimedia content in TYPO3 systems.

## Conclusion

These standards and guidelines provide a foundation for evaluating and improving TYPO3's translation capabilities. By aligning with these industry standards, TYPO3 can ensure greater interoperability with translation tools and services, improve the quality and efficiency of translation processes, and better meet the needs of organizations operating in a global context.
