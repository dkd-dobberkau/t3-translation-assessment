  - Documentation of assumptions where direct access is limited
  - Alternative analysis approaches for inaccessible components
  - Use of public APIs and documented interfaces where possible

#### 3. Communication Risk: Lack of feedback from the community
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Proactive outreach to key stakeholders
  - Multiple channels for community engagement
  - Incentives for survey participation (e.g., recognition, early access)
  - Direct outreach to known translation extension users
  - Flexibility in feedback collection methods

#### 4. Quality Risk: Insufficient data for meaningful recommendations
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive research approach using multiple sources
  - Early validation of research findings with experts
  - Iterative analysis approach with continuous refinement
  - Clear documentation of confidence levels for all findings
  - Contingency plan for targeted additional research if gaps identified

#### 5. Resource Risk: Key personnel unavailability
