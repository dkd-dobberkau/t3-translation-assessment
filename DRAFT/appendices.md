|------|------------|
| **All Languages** | A special language setting in TYPO3 with the fixed value `-1` that makes content elements visible in every language. |
| **BCP 47** | Internet Best Current Practice 47, a standardized format for language tags (e.g., "en-US", "de-DE") used for identifying languages in software applications. |
| **Connected Mode** | A TYPO3 translation approach where translated content elements maintain a reference to their Default Language parent records, enabling overlay functionality and relationship tracking. |

| **Context API** | A TYPO3 core API that provides contextual information, including current language settings via the `LanguageAspect` object. |
| **DataHandler** | A core TYPO3 class responsible for processing and persisting database operations, including translation-related operations. |
| **Default Language** | The primary language of a TYPO3 site, always assigned the fixed language ID `0`. All other languages are considered translations. |
| **Entity-Based Translation** | A translation approach (used by CMS platforms like Drupal) where all translations of content are treated as properties of a single multilingual entity rather than separate copies. |

| **Language Aspect** | Part of TYPO3's Context API that handles language-related information during page rendering. |
| **Language Fallback** | The process of displaying content from an alternative language when content in the requested language is unavailable. |
| **Language ID** | A numeric identifier used in TYPO3 to represent a specific language (e.g., `0` for Default Language, `1` for first additional language). |

| **l10n_diffsource** | A database field in TYPO3 that stores the original Default Language values used for highlighting changes in translated content. |
| **l10n_mode** | A TCA configuration option that controls how fields should be treated during translation, with options like `exclude` to prevent translation of specific fields. |
| **l10n_parent** | A database field in TYPO3 that stores the UID of the Default Language record for a translation. Also called `l18n_parent` in some tables like `tt_content`. |
